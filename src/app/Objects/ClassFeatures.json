You cannot use shields while berserking and you cannot use any systems or weapons that require a pilot skill check. During your berserk you may move and use heavy weapons in a single turn. Additionally you can use a single heavy weapon with one hand. Your other hand cannot use a heavy weapon. You gain +1 to RES and + 1 to STR during your berserk",
